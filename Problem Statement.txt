1. Extract/Read both CSV files to DataFrame

Read both the datasets into dataframes directly from the GitHub URLs.
2. Transform the data

A. Data Cleaning
In the orders dataset:
→ Fill missing quantity values with 1
→ Convert quantity column to integer data type
In the products dataset:
→ Fill missing category values with “unknown”

B. Merge
Perform an INNER JOIN between orders and products on product_id

C. Create Derived Column
revenue = quantity * price

D. Aggregation
Compute total revenue for each category using groupby
3. Output

Print the final aggregated DataFrame with the following columns: 
category and total_revenue

Sorted by total_revenue in descending order.
